This game is a direct port of its C++ counterpart (found in my MiniGames repo),
and part of a collection of mini-games I made in the past.
This game was originally written in Processing (Java), then ported to C++ (OficinaFramework/OpenGL), and now completely ported to JavaScript, using a 2D canvas element.
While rather simple, this is a very complete game that isn't easy nor hard; it has a score system (complete with local storage of highscore), chain bonus multipliers, and bonus points for some actions.

Please don't be a douche; do not deliberately steal this.
You can use the code as reference for your own games, as long as you respect the license.
This game uses [GohuFont](font.gohu.org) by Hugo Chargois, ported to TTF by [Guilherme Maeda](https://github.com/koemaeda/gohufont-ttf).
